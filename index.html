                            <p class="text-justify"> This project is Funded by UBA-IIT Delhi. Most of the cities, towns and villages in India are not well designed to facilitate the suitable garbage collection methods Common Public dustbins are filling over with the garbage and no one is concerned to clear them up as and when they get completely packed with overflowing garbage Keeping in view of this big problem, it will be a good suggestion to do something to deal with this unmanaged waste and from this, the concept of ‘Smart Dustbin’ came out.
</p> <p class="text-justify">
The main objective is to maintain the level of cleanliness in the city and form an environment which is better for living. By using this system, constantly check the level of the garbage in the dustbins which are placed in various parts of the city. If a particular dustbin has reached the maximum level, then the employees can be informed and they can immediately take certain actions to empty it as soon as possible. The employees can check the status of these bins anytime on their mobile phones. This can prove to be a very useful system if used properly. The system can be used as a benchmark by the people who are willing to take one step further for increasing the cleanliness in their respected area.</p>

<p class="text-justify"> Animal husbandry, apart from agriculture, is an integral part of livelihood for people in many developing countries including India. Cattles are one of the dominating members in livestock and require special attention as they produce demanding milk which is further used to make a number of derivatives like ghee, paneer etc. We are also experiencing rapid evolution of technology, mainly pivoted towards providing solutions to problems mostly concerning humans directly. Problems relating indirectly with humans are slowly being analyzed and worked on like the problem of cattle health monitoring. Humans consume dairy products on a daily basis and hence are vulnerable to any disease spread by infected cattle. Manual methods of monitoring cattle health are often slow, cumbersome and mandates to assign a person specially for it. This paper not only addresses this problem but also presents a practical solution to tackle it. The first prototype has been tested in parts and is currently under development for integration and site assembly</p>

<p class="text-justify">This project focuses on the instant monitoring of a renewable energy system through IoT based system, for optimizing the efficiency of it. The renewable energy system, that is the solar power plant, is monitored by keeping track of its performance determining parameters that are mainly voltage, current, and power. The voltage parameter from each array of the solar panels is abstracted and converted to a certain lower range, with the help of a voltage sensor, which is sustainable to the microcontroller. Similarly, the current is obtained from the current sensors of each of the solar panels and is further provided to the microcontroller. The monitoring platform is based on the current and voltage measurements of each row of solar panels. The related values are measured with the developed sensing circuits and are further processed by NodeMcu Esp8266 microcontroller. The processed parameters are then stored on the IoT cloud to offer smart data analysis, by the UBIDOTS platform. By the proper interpretation of data over the cloud, the cleansing process can be initiated by the user, by giving commands manually through the blynk application. The cleansing process deals with the dry cleaning mechanism for the system, in which a frame is set onto a particular dusty solar panel of the power system. The brushes made up of soft bristles are used to dust off, the dirt from the panel. Its rotating motion is controlled by the motors. </p>
<p class="text-justify"> Further, the frame with this assembly is mounted on the rollers, which helps the frame to traverse from one panel to another, to maintain the efficiency of the solar panels in the power system.</p>

                            <p>Car accidents are a serious issue in our country that needs to be resolved. One of the leading causes of car accidents is overspeeding. The traditional system used signboards for indicating the speed limit of the area. Most of the drivers ignore these signs while driving. This method seemed to be ineffective and has led to an increase in the number of accidents. This project aims to resolve this problem by creating an efficient speed limiting and accident alert system. So to alert the driver about the speed limit at slow speed zones and to detect crashes automatically, it is done by utilizing WSN, GPS, and IoT Technologies. The advantages of the proposed technology are, it saves around 5-6 minutes which are wasted in contacting the hospital and locating the crash site. Secondly, It alerts drivers entering slow speed zones by displaying speed limit, blinking of red LED, and beeping of a buzzer. Finally, the system reduces the speed of electric vehicles within slow-speed zones. This will help in reducing the number of accidents, thereby saving the uncountable number of lives across the country.</p>

                            <p class="text-justify">Most of the businessmen and farmers use traditional poultry farming methods. The traditional poultry farms lack proper and effective management to maintain health and growth of chicken. All the poultry
activities like filling the water tank, monitoring temperature, time to time feeding of chicken, cleaning the chicken waste and light control in the farm are done manually, Hence a large manpower is required.
So without automation it requires manual work to take care of poultry (chickens)and what if the care taker/owner is not present in farm and due to some environmental conditions, the poultry birds get harms or may die, that may affect the business. To reduce or to eradicate the death rate of poultry birds, some system is needed and automation is the only best solution. To design a remote controlled automatic poultry feeding system and temperature- humidity detection system. To implement an interface this will control the feeding and water supply and also collect the data of analog sensors to control the temperature and humidity of the poultry farm. To share the data over internet using IOT which allows the owner to access the devices from anywhere across the globe.</p>
